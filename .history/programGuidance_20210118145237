The requirements for the app are:

Users can search for Pokemon by name or type
The endpoint is GET /pokemon
The search options for either name or type are provided in query string parameters.
When searching by name, users are searching for whether the Pokemon's name includes a specified string. The search should be case insensitive.
When searching by type, users must specify one of the valid types.
The API responds with an array of full pokedex entries for the search results
Users can request a list of all the valid types of Pokemon.
The endpoint is GET /types
Both endpoints are public and only respond when given a valid Authorization header with a Bearer API token value.
Both endpoints should have general security in place

Make a new project for this application called pokedex-api, initialize it as an NPM project and Git, set up a .gitignore, install express, nodemon and set up the server.js file.

mkdir pokedex-api && cd $_
npm init -y
git init
echo "node_modules" > .gitignore
echo "console.log('hello')" > server.js
npm install express morgan
npm install nodemon -D
